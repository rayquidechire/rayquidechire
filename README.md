## Hi there, I'm Rayane 👋


💼 Former **bank advisor** turned **tech enthusiast** — I'm passionate about data, code, and creativity.

🎓 I specialize in **data analysis** and **business tech management**.

💻 I love **web and app development** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, always looking to build clean, user-focused experiences.

📊 I also work with **Power BI**, **Python**, **SQL**, and **Google Analytics** to turn raw data into smart insights.

⚽ Deeply into **football data analysis**, where I combine two passions: football and data.
